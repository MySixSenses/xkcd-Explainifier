# xkcd-Explainifier
This is a Chromium/Firefox-based extension that "explanifies" xkcd comics. When you click on the extension, then click explanify, it brings you to the explanified version of the comic on [Explainxkcd](explainxkcd.com).
This Github version is the development version of the extension and may be riddled with bugs and other problems.
